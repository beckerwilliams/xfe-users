# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

# 5 Stage Pipeline
# ingest is owned by Product Management
# dev & test are owned by R&D
# Promotion to release & prod incumbent on joint approval by Head of Product & CTO (or authorized delegates)



stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - dev-candidates
  - dev
  - test
  - release
  - prod

dev-candidates-job:  # Upon Dev Acceptance, move to DEV
  stage: dev-candidates
  script:
    - echo "IF Acceptance by DevLdrship Team"
    - echo "Story Accepted"
    - echo "ELSE - Story Rejected - <reason>"

build-job:       # runners needed: build, lint, unit-test, etc . . .
  stage: dev
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - echo "Code coverage is 0%"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - echo "No lint issues found."

release-job:      # This job runs in the staging stage.
  stage: release  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."

prod-job:  # For Cloud Platform Deployment
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
